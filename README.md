# 30 Days Of CSS
30 Days of CSS is a challenge to help you improve your coding skills by doing mini daily projects using HTML and CSS.

## Inspired By
This is a challenge from [this repo](https://github.com/MilenaCarecho/30diasDeCSS) that uploaded 30 CSS exercises with some rules to complete them and get better at CSS. I'll be changing a few of them since, while looking some of the challenges, i found it a little bit repetitive.

There's also an **Art** section to this project, so it's one challenge and one CSS art figure every day. The art comes mostly from `cssbattle.dev` but there will be a couple of other sources that i'll be linking if i use them (on that day's section).
